# libgdx-001

First attempt to build a Flappy Bird game.

Load the project on Android Studio on Windows.

Wait for Gradle to build. Don't run before it finishes.

Solve pendencies. Ignore demands for deleting files.

Run 'Desktop' and the game will load in a window (Windows OS only).

Unfinished work. You will be able to move up your bird by left clicking the mouse. 

Avoid the pipes. There is music and sounds for flapping the bird up.
